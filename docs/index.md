# sigmaNET

The sigmaNET project aims to provide a rigorous and performant tool for Network Science. 
It is aimed at anyone who works with Graphs/Networks and does not require a strong knowledge of F# to get started. 

# Getting Started 

## Prerequisites 

To set up a dev environment, we recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Ionide](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-fsharp) plugin  
You will also need [DotNet 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) installed.

The library is designed primarily for use in an fsharp scripting environment using .fsx files. 
But it also works well in [notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode).
This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ROKvmcOloo&list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oUFghYOp89baYFBTGxUkC7Z&index=3) has a good walk through of setting your environment.
